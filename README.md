# Monash-Sprint-Challenge
* This repo contains the data cleaning and the steps used to build the model for the sprint challenge.
* The code and data are part of the monash sprint challenge.
* Python3 and jupyter notebook environment are used.

* Description of the files:
* monash_sprint_challenge_task1.ipnb
* monash_sprint_challenge_task2.ipnb
* monash_sprint_challenge_task3.ipnb
* monash_sprint_challenge_task4.ipnb
* The above are the code files for each individual task.

* Provided data files for the challenge:
* dataset1_with_error.csv
* dataset2_integration.csv
* dataset3_with_missing.csv
* dataset4_with_outliers.csv

* Final cleaned and fixed datsets:
* dataset1_dataset2_solution.csv
* dataset1_solution.csv
* dataset3_solution.csv
* dataset4_solution.csv

* How to reproduce the project:
* Dowlaod all the files from the folder and intsall all the necessary software.(Jupyter notebook, python and libraries used) 
* Open the ipnb files and run them in the order.
